# Credit-Card-Lead-Detection
Identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card. The repository contains:

      CCDL.pkl : which is a trained model which can be used for prediction

      CCDL.ipynb : which shows the approach i.e. EDA, Pre-Processing, Making model, etc 

I have used decision tree classifier for this problem.
