# Credet-Card-Lead-Detection
Identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card
The repository contains:

  CCDL.pkl : which is a trained model which can be used for prediction
  
  CCDL.ipynb : which shows the approach i.e. EDA, Pre-Processing, Making model, etc 
  
  Solution.csv : contains the predicted value for test.csv
  
  test.csv : contains values to be predicted
  
  train.csv : contains training data
  
  code.py : a single python file for complete execution
  

I have used decision tree classifier for this problem.
